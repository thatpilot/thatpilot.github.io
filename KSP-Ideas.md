Jump to:

* [Travel Map](#travel-map)
* [Craft naming](#craft-naming-convention)

A quick log of ideas that need to be worked in.

- [ ] Can I move my crafts from `1.0.5` install?

## Rescue - priority 1

- [ ] Save ***Exp 2*** crew (2 Kerbals, ~157 orbit)
    - [ ] Modified ***Exp 1*** craft, add probecore
- [ ] Rescue Contract (1 Kerbal, ~90km orbit)
    - [ ] Can use same craft as above, include Tourist?

## LKO

### Outpost 1 Space Station
`Tantares`

| Orbit | Incl | Lab | Science exp | Docking | Copuola |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| 200km | 10 deg | Y | ? | `Tantares`-based docking ports | N? |

Docking:

| Front | End | Other |
|------|------|------|
| none | none | none |

###  Polar Orbit satelite with *Radar1* scanner
`ScanSat`
###  Polar Orbit satelite with *Resources* scanner
`ScanSat`
### SpaceShuttle style spaceplane. Can be based on some of the stock designs.
`Stock` & `MechJeb` 

>### Comm Network

>Awaiting `RemoteTech` update

>`RemoteTech` LKO 4 sat config;
>1 (or 2) *Molniya* orbit Deep Space Sats. 

## Mun exploration

#### Munar Lander Mk1
`Tantares` & `DMagic Science`

Lander based on ***Exp 1*** craft
Way to include *Material Science experiment*?

## Minmus exploration
### Minmus lander Mk1
Is ***Exp 1*** craft feasible here? Can we use the modifided, more powerfull luncher?
What about the `Lifesupport`? To get to Minmus and back it's what?
### Outpost 3 Station
Include *BiomeHopper* lander.

## Duna exploration

### Surveyor program
Polar Orbiter(s) with `ScanSat` scanners, `DMagic` science package

### Acorn program
`Karibou`, `MKS`, `Tantares`, `NearFuture`(?), `DMagic Science`
Three stages:
1. Perfect insitu resources conversion designs on **Mun**,
2. Put a *Habitat* on **Duna**,
3. Put a self-refueling Duna Ascent Vehicle near *Habitat*,
4. Land *KerbRover* ,
    - RoverDude's `Karibou Rover`?
5. Land and return Kerbals.
## Eve exploration

## Jool exploration

#Craft Naming convention
[Back to top](#ksp-11pre)

* mission to build a seed colony on Duna - DKBL Acorn
* duna ascent vehicle - DKAV Potato 
* Series of stations around Kerbin and it's moons - Outpost 1, 2, 3
* `ScanSat` powered orbiter - Spyglass or Calipers
* LKO crew shuttle - KKMLV IceTruck

I'm also using letters to designate vessel type so my Kerbin So I crewdelivery craft will be 

**K+KMLV** *IceTruck*

1. **K**erbin **+** (meaning it can reach both moons)
2. **K**erbalized
3. **M**ultipurpose
4. **L**FO powered
5. **V**ehicle

Kerbal crafts also needs to have name related to snacks, too!
